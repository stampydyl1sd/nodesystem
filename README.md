--++--++-- HOW DO I CREATE A ROUTE --++--++--

-- To create a route you will need "splines" which are tiny baby nodes.

-- These baby nodes are a guidance for the big ones.

-- Create a folder under "RoadSplines" in workspace | MUST BE IN WORKSPACE DO NOT MOVE!

-- Name it to your route! It MUST be like this "Route_XXX" or else the system might break!

-- Duplicate a part from one of the already made routes and drag it into the folder you just made.

-- Place the baby nodes (manually) across the road from start to beginning of the part.

-- Make sure as you go to name your parts P1, P2, P3 etc and make sure they're following the route taken!

-- For instance in ASCII ---> -------------------------------
--							  █								█
--							  -------------------------------

-- If you have a curve or want it to look smooth then follow the ASCII below:

--
-- ---------------------------\
-- █					   █ █ \
-- -------------------------\   \
--							 \	 \
--							  \	  \
--							   \   -----------------
--                              \ ██               █
--								 \------------------

-- Once you've finished with manually placing baby nodes you can move onto adding it into the system!

-- Head over to ReplicatedStorage and click _RoutesModule

-- Once inside simply follow the description / documentation on how to set it up!

-- Finished? Go into the game press F7 on your keyboard and type in "Bus Routes:" your route.

-- Allow up to a few seconds to load everything, when finished you should see your completed route with arrows!
